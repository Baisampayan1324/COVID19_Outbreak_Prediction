# COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict COVID-19 outbreaks using machine learning and deep learning models, with a focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series forecasting. The dataset includes COVID-19 case numbers, death counts, recovery rates, and testing statistics, enabling data-driven predictions to assist in outbreak management and public health decisions.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Processing:** Aggregates COVID-19 data from various sources, including official health organizations and open-source datasets.
- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Cleans and structures the data for optimal model performance.
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Utilizes LSTM and other deep learning models to predict future trends.
- **Visualization & Analysis:** Generates insightful graphs and trend analyses to interpret model results.
- **Deployment Readiness:** Enables integration into web or mobile applications for real-time prediction updates.
