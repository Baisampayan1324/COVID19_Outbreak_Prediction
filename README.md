# COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict COVID-19 outbreaks using machine learning and deep learning models, including LSTM for time-series forecasting. The dataset includes case numbers, deaths, and testing statistics.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place the dataset inside the `data/` folder.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook in `notebooks/` for data analysis and model training.
3. Use `src/preprocessing.py` for data cleaning.
4. Use `src/modeling.py` for machine learning and deep learning training.

## Results
- Trained an LSTM model for COVID-19 outbreak prediction.
- Saved model in `models/covid_lstm_model.h5`.
